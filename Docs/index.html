<ul>
<li>Every runnable thing within the locker is it&#8217;s own web service</li>
<li>The moving parts are: sources, sinks, collections, and apps</li>
<li>The locker ops code does the work to create contexts for these to work in and schedule/run them as needed</li>
<li>A collection knows what sources it can &#8220;run&#8221; and what contexts to run them in in order to get data</li>
<li>Sources are probably the best way to add value fast to the platform, the more places we enable getting data from the better</li>
<li>When something is started, it is given a filename that has it&#8217;s (json) config options for what it is supposed to be doing</li>
<li>Each thing also has a json file that describes itself to the system</li>
<li>To start, only node, python, and ruby are supported, and please don&#8217;t duplicate one in another language unless the first is fully untenable</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="notes">NOTES</h1>

<p>Very raw braindump notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Foo.app, Bar.connector, etc, any dir can have any number of each, scanned upon discovery/update</li>
</ul>

<p>A &#8220;service types&#8221; system, mimic mime types for collections/connectors, connectors list what they require and produce, apps can list what types they need to work</p>

<p>Collections - a connector advertises which type it produces (page/safari-bookmark), and that type has a spec of common attributes expected within the data for the first part (page), the second part should describe the native format from the source of the data (safari-bookmark)
    place/facebook
    place/foursquare
    photo/flickr
    contact/addressbook
    page/safari-bookmark
    page/safari-history</p>
