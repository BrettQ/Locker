These context creators contain just enough UI to step you through creating a new context, some with one step and some with a few.

Creating a context is unique to each service but there's often many common patterns to it, login-based, OAuth/OAuth2, etc, so if you're writing a new creator you might be able to easily copy an existing one to get it started.
