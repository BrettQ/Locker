Locker - the "me" platform
======================

This is an open source project that helps me collect all of my social data from wherever it is online into one place, and then lets me do really awesome stuff with it.

STATUS: eager-developer-friendly only at this point, we're working hard to make it usable for early adopters very soon, keep an eye on [@lockerproject](http://twitter.com/lockerproject) and [@jeremie](http://twitter.com/jeremie) for progress! 

* Connectors - Code that knows how to connect to and sync data with a place where I have data about myself, such as an account on a site or service, or in some desktop app, on my phone, or even from a device.
* Collections - My data from the many different sources gets organized into common collections, such as places, contacts, messages, statuses, pages, etc.
* Apps - Once my data is in my locker, I can then run apps locally within that locker that do useful or fun things for me without having to give my data up to any web site or give anyone access to my online accounts.

I am the platform.
