Each of these dirs should contain one source, one sink, or one of each (if they share most of the code).

To add/hack on anything here:

* first, see if you can extend/fix an existing one before creating another from scratch
* don't be afraid to start another if it's just easier, try to make sure it's distinct enough from others though if so
* if new, try to name it appropriately and follow the naming style
* if your data is pretty different than others, you may need to touch the related context and collection code to make them smart enough
